Conclusion:
Though this is the most simple model weâ€™ve built till now, the final predictors still seem to have high correlations. One can go ahead and remove some of these features, though that will affect the adjusted-r2 score significantly (you should try doing that).
Thus, for now, the final model consists of the 6 variables mentioned above.
