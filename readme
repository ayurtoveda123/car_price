Problem Description:
There is an automobile company XYZ from Japan which aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their US and European counterparts.
They want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market, since those may be very different from the Japanese market. Essentially, the company wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car
How well those variables describe the price of a car
Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different types of cars across the American market.
 to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels.
